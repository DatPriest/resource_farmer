# Resource Farmer

## Project Summary

Resource Farmer is a sandbox game developed using S&box, focusing on resource gathering, crafting, and exploration within a procedurally generated world. Players start with basic tools and must gather raw materials like wood and stone from the environment. These resources can then be used via a UI-driven crafting system, defined by `.recipe` files managed by the `RecipeManager`, to create better tools and items.

The game world is built upon a terrain generated by the `sturnus.terraingenerationtool`, offering varied landscapes. Resources are dynamically spawned across this terrain using the `ResourceSpawner` component, ensuring replayability and exploration incentives. Player interaction is handled through a standard player controller, allowing movement and basic actions like resource gathering. The `UIManager` handles toggling UI panels like the crafting menu.

### Current Key Features:

- **Procedural Terrain Generation:** Dynamic landscapes created at runtime or via editor tools.
- **Resource Spawning:** Automated placement of gatherable resources (e.g., trees, rocks).
- **Enhanced Inventory System:** Comprehensive resource management with capacity limits, sorting, and visual organization.
- **Basic Crafting System:** Craft items from recipes using collected resources via a dedicated UI panel.
- **Player Controller:** Standard movement and interaction capabilities.
- **UI Management:** System for handling in-game menus (Crafting, Settings, Inventory).

### Inventory System Features:

- **Capacity Management:** 1000-unit inventory with visual capacity indicator
- **Resource Organization:** Sort by name, amount, or category with search functionality
- **Rarity System:** Color-coded resources from Common to Mythic tiers
- **Interactive Management:** Individual resource actions (Use/Sell) and bulk operations
- **Modern UI:** Modal interface with drag & drop support and smooth animations
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Press 'I' to open/close inventory, ESC to close panels

## Future Vision

The long-term goal for Resource Farmer is to evolve into a more complex and engaging sandbox experience. Potential future development directions include:

- **Advanced Crafting:**
  - **Multi-Stage Crafting:** Requiring intermediate components or multiple steps to create complex items.
  - **Workstations:** Introducing specialized crafting stations (e.g., Forge, Workbench) needed for specific recipes.
  - **Item Quality/Modifiers:** Adding depth with varying item stats based on materials or crafting skill.
- **Farming & Planting:**
  - Allowing players to cultivate specific resources (plants, trees) near their base.
  - Introducing mechanics like soil types, watering, and growth cycles.
- **Professions & Skills:**
  - Implementing a skill system where players improve at specific tasks (Mining, Woodcutting, Crafting, Farming).
  - Potentially unlocking specialized recipes or abilities based on profession levels.
- **Building & Base Construction:**
  - Enabling players to build structures for shelter, storage, and housing workstations.
- **More Complex Economy:**
  - Introducing NPC traders or player-to-player trading systems.
- **Expanded World:**
  - Adding more biomes, resources, creatures, and points of interest to the procedural generation.

The aim is to build upon the current foundation to create a rich sandbox environment where players can shape the world, specialize their skills, and engage in a satisfying progression loop.
